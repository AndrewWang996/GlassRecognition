# Face Detection and Recognition on Google Glass #
This application enable user to detect faces (real-time) and create their own database for face recognition.

## Setup (copied from *https://github.com/space150/google-glass-playground/tree/master/OpenCVFaceDetection*) ##
1. Install and configure the OpenCV4Android SDK. Thorough instructions can be found in the OpenCV4Android SDK tutorial.
2. Google Glass does not have the Google Play store installed, so you will need to manually install the OpenCV Manager apk. Google Glass is running armeabi-v7a, so the OpenCV_x.x.x_Manager_x.x_armv7a-neon.apk manager apk is needed.
3. Update the library reference in this project to point to your OpenCV4Android library.
4. Build and run the project.
